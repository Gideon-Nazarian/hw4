Programming Problem Notes
For each programming problem, let us know:

//How we should compile your code (g++ command or make target):

use make to compile code and ./NAMEOFTEST for test cases
// Design decisions you made or other non-trivial choices for your implementation

I attempted to make the AVLtree by height but the BST is fine
//Any additional tests you wrote and what files those exist in -none

//Known errors/anything to help us grade (though we will run automated tests, knowing what features may be broken/missing may help us provide some partial credit):
AVL tree does not entirely work, but BST works fully
